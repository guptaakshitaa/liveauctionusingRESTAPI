# 🏷️ Live Auction Platform

*A real-time auction system built during MLH API Week*

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **live auction platform** developed as part of **MLH API Week**, focused on building scalable backend systems and integrating APIs for real-time user interaction. The platform enables users to create auctions, place bids in real time, and track auction status dynamically.

The project emphasizes **backend engineering, API design, and system reliability**, simulating real-world auction workflows.
